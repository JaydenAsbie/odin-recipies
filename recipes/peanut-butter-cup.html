    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Have you ever craved something sweet but then realized you wanted something salty, too? There's magic in satisfying both at once â€” without running to the store to pick up a Reese's peanut butter cup. Instead, turn your home into a candy factory and make your own using three simple ingredients: peanut butter, powdered sugar, and chocolate. It's the ultimate fusion of flavors, combining the nutty richness of peanut butter with the sweetness of powdered sugar, all encased in a luscious coat of melted chocolate. The best part? They're a breeze to make, with steps so easy that even a kitchen newbie can become a candy maker in no time.</p>

        <li>3 tablespoons powdered sugar, sifted</li>
        <li>1/2 cups creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 cup chocolate, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Spread 1 to 2 tablespoons of chocolate in the bottom of each cupcake liner.</li>
        <li>Dollop 1 to 2 teaspoons of the peanut butter mixture on top of the chocolate.</li>
