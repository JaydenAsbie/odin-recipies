   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Eating a bowl of mac and cheese is like taking a trip down memory lane. Think back to those childhood dinners where a steaming pot of macaroni and cheese awaited, its irresistible allure of gooey, cheesy goodness promising pure comfort. Now, imagine recreating that nostalgic magic with our exclusive 3-ingredient mac-hack. You read that correctly: just three simple ingredients lead to culinary bliss. We've stripped away the complexity (no roux needed!) without compromising on flavor, using only the essentials — milk, cheese, and pasta — to craft a quick and easy meal that surpasses the boxed version in every way. </p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>5 Cups milk</li>
    <li>1 lb elbow macaroni, dry</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>In a large pot, bring the milk to a boil.</li>
    <li>Add the pasta and stir constantly until the pasta is cooked, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat, then add the cheddar. Stir until the cheese is melted and the pasta is evenly coated.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
