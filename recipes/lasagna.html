   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Ground Beef</li>
    <li>Diced Union</li>
    <li>Store-bought pasta sauce</li>
    <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>Shredded parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>One large egg</li>
    <li>Dried oregano</li>
    <li>Dried Parsely</li>
    <li>Garlic Powder</li>
    <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Cook the Beef:</strong>First, preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. While it heats, cook the diced onion and ground beef in a large skillet until browned. Now add your pasta sauce to the beef mixture and stir to coat. Simmer over low heat until you are ready to assemble the lasagna.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Boil the Lasagna:</strong>Next, boil water in a large pot. Add the box of lasagna noodles and boil noodles following the package directions. Don’t worry if some of the noodles are broken. They will still work just fine in the lasagna.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Make the Ricotta Mixture:</strong>Combine the egg, ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, dried parsley, dried oregano, and garlic powder in a medium bowl. Mix and set aside.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>spread one cup of the sauce with meat in the bottom of a greased 9×13 baking dish. Next, place 3 lasagna noodles lengthwise in the baking dish over the meat sauce.  Then spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Top with ¾ cup mozzarella cheese and 1/3 of the remaining meat mixture.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Repeat layers in the same order: noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, meat.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Finish by adding the last layer of noodles topped with the remaining sauce. Bake covered with a piece of tin foil in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Uncover the lasagna, add the remaining mozzarella cheese, and bake for another 5 minutes or until the cheese melts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Let it stand for about 5 minutes before slicing and serving with your favorite sides.</p>
    </li>
